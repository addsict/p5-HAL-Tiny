# SYNOPSIS

    use HAL::Tiny;

    my $resource = HAL::Tiny->new(
        state => +{
            currentlyProcessing => 14,
            shippedToday => 20,
        },
        links => +{
            self => '/orders',
            next => '/orders?page=2',
        },
        embedded => +{
            order => [
                HAL::Tiny->new(
                    state => +{ id => 10 },
                    links => +{ self => '/orders/10' },
                ),
                HAL::Tiny->new(
                    state => +{ id => 11 },
                    links => +{ self => '/orders/11' },

    - embedded

        The hash of embedded objects.
        Each hash value must be an array of HAL::Tiny objects or a HAL::Tiny object.

- **as\_json** - Encode to json.
